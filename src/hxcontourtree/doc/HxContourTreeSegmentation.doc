\begin{hxdescription}
This module computes a segmentation of the image data based on the idea of the
contour tree.  It traverses all voxels in the order of decreasing scalar values
up to a given user-defined {\em threshold}.  If a new local maximum is found,
this voxel gets a new label.  Each new voxel that is neighbored to an already
labeled voxel gets the same label as its neighbor.  If a voxel is neighbored to
two or more voxels with different labels, a merge in terms of a contour tree
merge happens.  At this point, the two labeled regions will be merged if the
difference between one of the maxima and the value at the current voxel is less
then a user-defined {\em persistence value}.  Note that the objects to be
segmented must have larger values than the background.  If this is not the case,
use the \link{HxArithmetic}{Arithmetic} module to invert the image data.

There is a faster, nearly similar version of this algorithm that can be activated
with the \link{HxContourTreeSegmentation_fastSegmentation}{Fast segmentation} port.
Here, the algorithm becomes a hierarchical watershed segmentation (just from high values
to low values) where the implementation is based on the contour tree.

The output segmentations are 32 bit label fields.

The whole workflow for object separation using this module is described in a 
separate \link{tutContourTreeSegmentation}{tutorial}.

\begin{hxports}
\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_auto-initialization}
\hxport{Auto-initialization}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_auto-initialization}\\
Switches on or off the auto-initialization of the threshold and persistence
values.  The values of the ports {\em Threshold} and {\em Persistence value} can
be computed automatically.  For this purpose, the settings of the ports {\em
Persistence mode} and {\em Persistence options} are used.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_threshold}
\hxport{Threshold}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_threshold}\\
The threshold up to which voxels are considered.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceMode}
\hxport{Persistence mode}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceMode}\\
This port allows switching between different modes to set and to compute the
persistence criterion:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf absolute}: The persistence value is a absolute value of the range of
scalar values in the field.

\item {\bf relative}: The persistence value is normalized with respect to a
range of scalar values, which can be chosen in port {\em Persistence options}.
The relative persistence is in the range between 0 and 1.

\item {\bf adaptive}: The persistence value is interpreted as the ratio between
the persistence and the smaller maximum of the two current regions.  This
criterion is locally computed for each merge pair during the propagation
process.

\end{itemize}

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceOptions}
\hxport{Persistence options}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceOptions}\\
This port determines which range of scalar values is used to adjust or to
normalize the persistence value in {\em absolute} or {\em relative} mode,
repsectively.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf range}: This option applies the adjustment or the normalization to
the entire intensity range of the input data.

\item {\bf histogram}: This option computes the histogram of the scalar values
in the data set and determines the range by omitting the smallest and largest 5
percent of the data values.

\end{itemize}

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceValue}
\hxport{Persistence value}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceValue}\\
The {\em persistence value} allows the user to define the level at which regions
are merged.  The larger this value, the more likely it is that regions will be
merged.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_minimalSegmentSize}
\hxport{Minimal segment size}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_minimalSegmentSize}\\
Regions consisting of less voxels than the {\em minimal segment size value}
are merged whenever possible.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_sortNeighborsBy}
\hxport{Sort neighbors by}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_sortNeighborsBy}\\
If a voxel is neighbored to regions with different labels, it is not
clear to which of these regions the voxel will be assigned.  Two
strategies are implemented in this module.  If {\em value} is
selected, the voxel will be assigned to the region of the neighbor
with the largest value.  Otherwise, a majority vote is carried out
and the voxel is assigned to the region where most of its neighbors
belong to.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_fastSegmentation}
\hxport{Fast segmentation}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_fastSegmentation}\\
If checked, the module applies a faster algorithm to compute the
segmentation. The algorithm becomes a hierarchical watershed segmentation (just from high values
to low values) where the implementation is based on the contour tree.
The main idea is to compute the finest segmentation
(minimal segment size 0 and persistence value 0) in a preprocessing step.
In the following iteration through the data set, the algorithm merges
these precomputed labels based on their size and based on the persistence
value. The result is only exactly the same as in the default algorithm if
the minimal segment size is 0 and neighbors are ordered due to majority vote.
If the minimal segment size is 0 and neighbors are ordered due to value,
then the results are very similar (most probably no differences or just a
few changed voxels). If the minimal segment size is larger than 0, then the
results differ a lot, the fast algorithm contains more labels because the
precomputed segments are already larger when they are compared with the
minimal segment size.

For the first use or if there are changed parameters, an internal
initialization is necessary. That initialization will need more time
than a regular segmentation step but afterwards the fast segmentation
is much faster.

\hxlabel{HxContourTreeSegmentation_calculatePlot}
\hxport{Plot}\\
\hximage{HxContourTreeSegmentation_calculatePlot}\\
Computes a plot showing the resulting number of labeled regions according to
the persistence value. The maximum persistence value (on the x axis) is determined
by the \link{HxContourTreeSegmentation_persistenceValue}{Persistence value} port.
Minimal segment size and fast computation are taken into account.
